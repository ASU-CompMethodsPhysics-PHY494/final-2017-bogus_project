\subsection*{Problem}
\paragraph{} The mechanics of quantum physics are strange. One of the (many) difficulties of understanding the quantum world is the reliance of simplified one-dimensional situations to introduce students to a particle's odd wave-like behavior. But we, as far as I know, live in a three-dimensional world and I want to know what a 3D particle looks like. How does it interact over time with rigid or dynamic potential barriers? What does quantum tunneling look like in 3D? Can these be modeled accurately by a computer?

\subsection*{Approach}
\paragraph{} The main obstacle to answering these questions will be solving Schr\"odinger's equation in three dimensions. It will be necessary to include a time-dependence to model the dynamic situations we will create by answering the questions above. Specifically, we will be attempting to use the real/imaginary position integration scheme by Maestri \textit{et al}.:
\begin{multline}
R^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = R^{n-1}_{i,j,k} + 2[(4\alpha + \frac{1}{2}\Delta tV_{i,j,k})I^n_{i,j,k} - \alpha (I^{n}_{i+1,j,k} + I^{n}_{i-1,j,k}\\ + I^{n}_{i,j+1,k} + I^{n}_{i,j-1,k} + I^{n}_{i,j,k+1} + I^{n}_{i,j,k-1})]
\end{multline}
\begin{multline}
I^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = I^{n-1}_{i,j,k} + 2[(4\alpha + \frac{1}{2}\Delta tV_{i,j,k})R^n_{i,j,k} - \alpha (R^{n}_{i+1,j,k} + R^{n}_{i-1,j,k}\\ + R^{n}_{i,j+1,k} + R^{n}_{i,j-1,k} + R^{n}_{i,j,k+1} + R^{n}_{i,j,k-1})]
\end{multline}
\paragraph{} To visualize the particle's behavior, we will model the \textit{probability} of detecting the particle at any position. The value of the probability at a data point will be calculated from the above integration scheme. Visualizing a probability density in 3D can be difficult, so we'll be using the yt package which can be installed into the Anaconda distribution of Python.

\subsection*{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt, parsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt]
\item Test algorithm by simulating the behavior of a quantum wavepacket in enclosed 2D spaces.
