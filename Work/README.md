### wavepacket.py
### Created by Brian Pickens, Nate Chrisman, and Andrew Shurman
###
### Creates and calculates a full simulation dataset for all time steps
### Object's dataset is later passed to visualization.py for animation

For 2D Simulations:

-Leave variable 'sim3D = False'. 

-Create wavePacket object, arguments for latticeSize and simulation time must be entered, along with types of initial conditions (only accepts Gaussian) and whether or not it is an infinite potential or harmonic. 

-Change file name for view.animateDataSet, insert dataset to use as an argument



For 3D Simulations:

-Change boolean to reflect 'sim3D = True'

-Create wavePacket object, arguments for latticeSize and simulation time must be entered, along with types of initial conditions (only accepts Gaussian) and whether or not it is an infinite potential or harmonic. 

-Change file name for view.animateDataSet, insert dataset to use as an argument
