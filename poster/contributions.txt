To start off the project, nachrisman implemented the integrator as outlined in the Computational Physics text. Physgun implemented the probability density algorithm. ashurmanator implemented initial conditions and Gaussian calculations. Physgun also implemented the visualization tools via yt and imageio modules. All team members worked diligently to optimize code to be memory efficient, as bug free as possible, and to implement defensive programming techniques. 

Ongoing discussion about the validity of the results was happening throughout the duration of the project and all team members contributed equally to providing solutions in order to resolve any conflicts with the desired results vs. actual results. All team members also contributed to the content of the poster.
