The goal of this project was to visualize a quantum wavepacket in 2-D and 3-D within a box and isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The method of approach included the use of a stepping algorithm to determine the real and imaginary parts of the wave equation in alternating half time-steps (Maestri et al.) and then using two modules, YT and imageio, to create images of the time-evolution of the wavepacket. To test the accuracy of the solutions, constant calculations of total probability and the observation of phenomena such as quantum revival were used. Images of a wavepacket in both potentials was observed, however, these proved to be incorrect as neither probability was conserved nor was quantum revival observed. The cause of the error has yet to be determined even through extensive reworking of the algorithm implementation This has lead us to believe that the problem maybe with the algorithm itself and another will need to be found. Future work would include exploring other algorithms that meet our requirements.
